## Unlocking ARCO: Analysis-Ready Cloud-Optimized Data transformation in practice

### Run on mybinder.org
*Note: many parts of this repo are moderately memory-intensive and may not preform well (or at all) on the limited resources available on mybinder.org. It is recommended that you run this locally or on a more robust cloud-based jupyter instance*

### Run on GESIS
*This is a separate service from the [Leibniz Institute of Social Sciences](https://www.gesis.org/en/home) that hosts its own Binder setup with more memory, and thus may work better that mybinder.org*
